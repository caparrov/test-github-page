## Cold and warm cache: MVM

Figure1  analyzes a double-precision floating-point matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) run
with both cold and warm cache. In the former, memory latency (and bandwidth, which is included
in all memory bottleneck lines) is the bottleneck as expected (the matrix has to be loaded and
is not reused). The peak performance is not reached because dependences prevent the full issue
bandwidth to be used and introduce non-compute cycles due to RS stalls and arithmetic latency.
In the warm cache scenario, L1 becomes the limiting resource. The peak performance is not
reached because dependences again prevent the full issue bandwidth to be used and produce ROB
stalls and latency effects. It is also interesting to observe how bottlenecks change from one scenario to the other, even
if they are not the ones that limit performance. In the cold cache scenario, e.g., the computation
issue bottleneck suggests that even if the latency of floating-point operations and stall cycles are
removed, only half of the resources are being utilized; the reason is that the long latency memory
operations prevent the exploitation of available ILP from the application. This bottleneck is
considerable reduced in the warm cache scenario.

## Bottlenecks for different sizes

Bottlenecks may also change with the input size. Figure 2 shows the generalized roofline plots for fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) of sizes 2^10 and 2^20. For the small size, L1 latency and bandwidth is the
limiting resource and the peak is not reached because of latency effects. For larger sizes, more
performance bounds appear because the application accesses more levels of the memory hierarchy,
and new execution stalls due to OoO buffers appear (most stalls are due to ROB). Actually, all
the possible bottleneck lines appear, which means that all buffers create execution stalls.

## Different implementations of the same application

We compare how bottlenecks change across different implementations of matrix-matrix multiplication
(MMM) of square matrices of size 500. Fig. 4.17 shows the generalized roofline plots for (a)
a triple loop implementation and (b) a six-fold loop version, which is known to have better locality
and, hence, better performance as shown in the figure. In both implementations, execution stall
cycles due to the ROB occupancy and latency cycles of floating-point computations are important
contributors to the execution time, and the associated bottleneck lines hit the performance point.
While in the blocked implementation only the L1 latency appears as a bottleneck, in the triple
loop implementation, the L2 latency limits performance as much as the L1 latency. In none of the
cases the memory-related (mem) bottlenecks show up because the three matrices fit within the
last-level cache. Note that although blocking is an optimization that targets improving locality,
it also reduces the floating point latency bottleneck.
The generalized roofline plots in Fig. 4.17 show that the notion of compute- and memorybound
change when more resources than just throughput and memory bandwidth are taken into
account. MMM is known to be compute-bound [23], and in fact it is with respect to the throughput
and memory bandwidth roofs. However, the generalized roofline plots show that latency cycles
associated with memory accesses contribute largely to the execution time of the kernel, as much
as the cycles spent on computation.
